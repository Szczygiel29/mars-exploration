## Project Description

The Mars Rover Exploration Simulator project is a Java application that allows for the creation and simulation of rover exploration on a planet. 
The application generates a random map with specified dimensions and various options, which is then saved to a text file (txt).
After saving the map, the program enables the placement of a rover on the surface and simulates its exploration based on the loaded map.

## Features

- Generate a random map of the planet Mars with specified dimensions.
- Save the map to a text file in txt format.
- Create and control the rover on the planet's surface.
- Simulate rover movement based on the loaded map.
- Verify map validation and rover movement.

## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your device.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourRepository/mars-rover-simulator.git
```

## Sample Use Cases

The project can be used to experiment with various rover exploration strategies on the planet Mars. 
You can also customize map generation and rover movement validation to adapt the project to your specific needs.
